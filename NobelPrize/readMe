To run 
npm start
http://localhost:4000/#/

//click the check box to add a new person

1- Get all the Nobel winners
2- Get Details for each winners
3- Delete one winner
4-Add Next and prev pages
5- Add search from DB and front end

To add next and previos button 
my idea is 
To add the count and offset to data factory to return the certin amount of winners
 then in the listHtml
 I want to add next and previous with count and offset and each time you click next 
 will check if countMax is less than of equal the contents
